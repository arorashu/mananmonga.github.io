<h1>Bare Metal Marketplace</h1>
<ul>
<li>Universities have labs with unused compute many days of the week, other labs could do with extra compute on the same days, and to solve this problem we built a free marketplace to buy and sell time on Bare-Metal nodes
</li>
<li>I took responsibility for writing up the matching algorithm in Python and went in-depth with my project mentors Orran Krieger and Sahil Tikale to make sure that malicious entities would not be able to game the marketplace and exert an unwanted influence on trading times and prices. This algorithm underwent extensive functional testing to ensure optimal matches between offers and bids.  
</li>
<li>  The importance of loosely coupled N-Tier architecture in the marketplace was established early on and we built a microservices framework that would be highly available and fault tolerant.
